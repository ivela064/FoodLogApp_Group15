# FoodLogApp_Group15
Hello dear TAs and professor, this is our code repository for our Proof of Concept(POC) for the company S.I.M which we 'created' as Group 15 of the course Software Engineering Project Management from the University of Ottawa Nov-Dec-2022

How to run the code:

1. Download the code from the repository
2. In your IDE (e.g Microsoft Visual Studio) use the open folder option to open the folder downloaded.
3. We have provided a file called requirements.txt which contains all the necessary libraries and modules needed to run the code. 
So run this code in your IDE to install these requirements to be able to run the code.

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Finally just run the command

streamlit run FoodLogApp.py

- We are using the service Streamlit which allows the user to commit a website in real time which we use to deploy the app, FoodLogApp.py is the main source of the code and FoodLogApp.ipynb is a file where we set the machine learning modules where we train the AI so it learns from several images to understand how to detect food.

- We have used a group of images(dataset) from these two websites [Food Dataset 1](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/) - [Food Dataset 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition)
